# FIELD OF APPLICATION
• High resolution module, 10 cm

• Fast conversion down to 1 ms

• Low power, 1 µA (standby < 0.15 µA)

• Integrated digital pressure sensor (24 bit ΔΣ ADC)

• Operating range: 10 to 1200 mbar, -40 to +85 °C

• I2C and SPI interface up to 20 MHz



# DESCRIPTION
The MS5611-01BA is a new generation of high resolution altimeter sensors from MEAS Switzerland with SPI and I2C bus interface. 
This barometric pressure sensor is optimized for altimeters and variometers with an
altitude resolution of 10 cm. The sensor module includes a high linearity pressure sensor and an ultra low power
24 bit ΔΣ ADC with internal factory calibrated coefficients. It provides a precise digital 24 Bit pressure and
temperature value and different operation modes that allow the user to optimize for conversion speed and
current consumption. A high resolution temperature output allows the implementation of an
altimeter/thermometer function without any additional sensor.


# FIELD OF APPLICATION
• Mobile altimeter / barometer systems
